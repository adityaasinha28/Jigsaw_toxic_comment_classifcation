This is the reason for that... I have a few Jewish friends, and normally we sometimes make jokes about jews and christians and things like that. I never really make jokes about the holocaust, because that never go over well with them and it is not nice... well, apparently, a joke about jews being lawyers set one of my closest friends off who is not really a jew, but claims he is.... now he thinks I am a facist, nazi, and I hate jews.... i gotreally frustrated and annoyed and so I came home and started messing around on my userpage... Second of all, i would like to ask why it is not permissable to \"\"self identify as a nazi\"\"? There are several userboxes dealing with this subject. There is even a userbox that states, \"\"This user identifies as a Hitlerist! WHAT THE HELL?!?!?! You will let people say they support Hitler, but you won\\'t let them say they are nazis?!? Being a nazi does not mean that you condone Hitler or his actions, it simple means that you support the theory of the politics behind Nazism.... you can be a nazi and not support the horrible eugenics policy. But if you are hitlerist, that obviously says you support all that... your arguement would of course be that it is offensive to jews.... well if you are taking that into account, then you should also ban anyone that says they identify as a communist. That can be extremely offensive to christians... if you want me to, I can talk about all the horrible things they did to christians in communist russia (with reference of a nice book). I think I will... one of the things they did was putting shackles on the ankles and wrists of christians with spikes of the inside that cut into your skin if you moved at all... and then they put starved rats into your cell that tried to eat you alive so you had to fight them off while your wrists and ankles are killing you. They also tied you to a cross and hung you upside down over a huge pile of other prisoners crammed into a small room. You were then forced to excrete over everyone. You were also stood upright in a box while they drove long nails into it. It was alright if you stood perfectly still, but you would have to stand there for hours and then your body would sway and poke into the nails. They also stood you naked in a freezer with a doctor nearby that signalled when you were freezing to death and then they would take you out and warm you up. They would do that for hours on end. Then they would beat you over and over again asking you to renounce Christ... the holocaust was horrible, but I would rather be gassed or hung by a nazi than endure those tortures for 18 years like one man who wrote a book about his experiences... so could you ban all communists please? \\nMy last comment is in response to Chzz\\'s question about me making the \\'gay comment\\' statement.

       " array(['Request to Unblock\\nI began writing the following statement (excepting its two postscripts) before I was blocked. I suspect that User: AuburnPilot had me blocked, in order to prevent me from complaining to administrators about his misconduct. Although I was directed to request an unblock of User: Physicq210, who had blocked me, requesting such of the latter would require that I censor myself, and write as though User: Physicq210 had acted in good faith, and was one of the good guys. That would be surreal, and would give User: Physicq210 a moral legitimacy belied by his actions. And so, the following request for unblocking is directed at any administrator BUT User: Physicq210, but since I’m not a devious sort, I have nothing against the latter reading this. Indeed, I want User: Physicq210 to read it. For if I can be banned from Wikipedia for standing up to censors, then it is vastly preferable to go down fighting, than to go down the long dark road of self-abnegation and self-censorship, including the use of bad English. After all, if I wanted to be a lackey, I could go to graduate school.\\n\\nWIKI Administrators’ Notice Board Incidents\\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents\\n\\nUser: AuburnPilot\\n\\nA few days ago, User: AuburnPilot began stalking me, checking wherever I had made edits, and going to the articles in question and vandalizing them. He or she has been manipulating Wikipedia rules as cover for what is clearly political censorship. User: AuburnPilot cannot even stand for Wikipedia readers to find out about factual material that upsets his political applecart through footnotes. Zero tolerance!\\n\\nHe claims of any source he politically dislikes, that it is either “spam” or a “blog” (or “POV,” another favorite dodge for those at Wikipedia seeking to censor those who fail to conform to their own POV), even though the one source is a previously published, classic magazine article otherwise unavailable on the Web (http://geocities.com/nstix/waronpolice.html), which the author has seen fit to publish on his Web site, and the other source is the longest, most thorough exposé yet published on the Duke rape hoax (http://vdare.com/stix/070113_duke.htm).\\n\\nNote that I am not even talking about censoring writing within articles, since I hadn’t done any writing on the articles in question: Crystal Gail Mangum, Michael Nifong, 2006 Duke University lacrosse team scandal and Racial profiling.\\nI’ve been involved in edit wars before, though I have never been the aggressor, and have never initiated an elective edit war, though given the self-assurance that aggressors such as User: AuburnPilot exude, perhaps I ought to reconsider that position. It seems that aggressors rule here.\\n\\nThe reason I am making a formal complaint is that User: AuburnPilot has tonight upped the ante, threatening to have me banned\\n(http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:70.23.199.239&redirect;=no), if I do not surrender to his censorship. Should you find for me, please serve this individual with the wikiquivalent of a cease-and-desist order. Should you, however, find for the censor, please provide an Index of banned publications and a list of official wikicensors.\\n\\nP.S. January 19, 2007 115A EST. Since beginning this complaint, I see that User: AuburnPilot has in fact succeeded at getting a crony, User: Physicq210, to block me, thus not only getting administrative support in censoring me, but preventing me from responding to his thuggery. (And no, I am not going to use cutesy, euphemistic language. If I were into such deception, I would have become a liar, er, lawyer, and would be worthless as an encyclopedist.) And I was unable to e-mail User: Physicq210 because I am not logged in and “You must be logged in and have a valid authenticated e-mail address in your preferences to send e-mail to other users.” (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Emailuser/Physicq210)\\n\\nIf this isn’t cyber-Stalinism, I don’t know what is! So, let me get this straight. Stalking and censoring an editor while using the equivalent of smiley faces (User: AuburnPilot’s penchant for saying “Thank you” after vandalizing one’s links) is “civil,” but complaining about such abuse counts as “spam, disruption, incivility, and personal attacks.” If that is verily so, then 2 + 2 = 5.\\n\\nP.P.S The message here says that I was “temporarily blocked from editing Wikipedia as a result of your disruptive edits.” What the heck is that supposed to mean? For restoring footnotes and links that User: AuburnPilot had vandalized? If that constitutes “disruptive edits,” then you’ve utterly given up on honest English and all human decency.

I give him my information as to why  my edits are valid then. \\n\\nAnd Deepak goes back calling me a troll, and a nazi, and a pro India dude. \\n\\nAnd this kind of stuff goes on and on and on...you get the idea.....he ignores information you give him. He picks and chooses what he wants to answer. And he doesnt even answer the logic you give him sometimes. But he wastes his time in name calling, and insluts, and putting you down then. \\n\\nSo then after a while i get annoyed. And i remind him how things got this bad between us. I type and type and type and type just like i am now. \\n\\nAnd Deepak ignores most of what i typed. \\n\\nMany times i write him these long replies where i answer all his points, where i tell him why its wrong for him to insult me and put me down, and why its wrong for him to ignore the information i have as to why i want to make an edit, or whatever it is im bringing up then.....and no matter how much i write....even if i write these long replies to him then....even if i answer every point he brings up....he usually either ignores most of what i wrote down....or....he picks and chooses what he wants to answer.....or.....he just responds back by calling me a troll, or accusing me of being pro nazi or something, or accusing me of ignoring his points (which is so not true cus i respond to pretty much everything he says then), or accusing me of not understanding what he is telling me, or just accusing me of being pro India then (which I am) or just insulting me, or just name calling me, or just putting me down. \\n\\nSo then after a while i get so annoyed cus he's this a guy here then with me now, and so i start to call him names. I call him a dictator. I call him the ruler of wikiepdia. And I tell him how he ignores my points. \\n\\nAnd then Deepak tells me how i cant call him names, and how i cant throw mud at him, and how im breaking wikipedia rules\\n\\nSo then I ask him how comes its ok for him to name call me and i cant? How come its ok for him to throw mud at me but I cant then? How come its ok for him to break Wikipedia's rules but I can't then? \\n\\nAnd Deepak has no logical answer....or....he won't respond to those questions that I ask him then . Or he just ignores what i ask him, and goes back to accusing me of being a troll, or acting like im a pro nazi or something then , or just insult's me in general then......\\n\\nSo then I get more annoyed and call him thing's like a dictator, which as you can see here with our history, this is how he acts.....isn't it true?.....he ignores most of my points and picks and chooses what he wants to answer.....sometimes he won't even answer you at all.....and sometime's he just insults you then . So it's logical if get annoyed and call him a dicator right?\\n\\nWrong....Deepak then holds it against you that your name calling him...and threaten's to block you, or report you, or he just tel\",\n",

Perković has been known to openly promote Ustaša ideology because he wears black clothes, salutes in the corresponding way and had often openly supported the Ustaše and the NDH in his statements to the media. \\n\\nUltra-nationalism?Ultra-nationalism means that you want to destroy everything that is not of your nation.While patriotism means that you love your own nation,but you respect others.Where in his songs does he promote hate to other nations?And no mentioning songs created in time of war against the Serbs,because it was the time of war.And only mention songs written by him.Not what he is accused of performing.\\n\\n Hatred toward SDP?Where?Name source.He is right wing,that si widely known.Of course he disagrees with their politics and he considers their politics bad for Croatia,but hatred?

We call that petitio principii, don't we? Apparently nothing will change his mind until I change my pen-name to something like John Doe. How does he know that I am not this Russian dude who likes Iranian history and culture? Oh, that's right, he doesn't.

It has no bearing on content or the essentials of an argument, and anything else you might conjure to the favour of some imagined affiliation.

It deserves a Wiki-article, where Jona Lendering is briefly described as the founder and maintainer of an outlet with roots as far back as -96. Yes, sounds like a plan of revenge. The paragon of Pan-Iranic resurgence! The removal of a Wiki-article of Lendering will remove the last great obstacle to a resurgent Achaemenid empire and the reawakening of the terrifying Persian horsemen of doom! Howl! Howl! Our world is forfeit!\\n\\nSecond point, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart: Get laid. Your superior-inferior complex isn't convincing anyone here, whether they be Iranian or not. There is no chance an article of this quality gets to stay. That's the bottom line, irrespective of any perceived reasoning. Either change the article so that it pertains to Livius.org, or stop your incessant whining. Maybe it never occurred to you that by simple observation Jona Lendering has written several Iran-friendly articles and has generally sought to dispel several popular misconceptions on the ancient Iranians. Maybe that's how you make more drama in your life, by arbitrary holier-than-thou attitude.\\n\\nIdiot.\",\n",

Where before Schengen you could renew your visitor visa by simply leaving and re-entering the country you were teaching in, now you must apply for a work permit, which is a costly and difficult process for Americans and Canadians.  Now, because of Schengen, Americans and Canadians are no longer welcome in Europe to teach English. I have heard of many well intentioned ESL teachers who were travelling between, say Germany and Czech Republic and did not have the proper 'poste Schengen' visa documentation: they were arrested by the police and forcibly stuck on a plane back to America.  No sympathy for their situation, no regard for all their belongings in their flat in Prague, no concern whatsoever: they were treated like criminals breaking the law.  This is the ugly side of Schengen: it is used to keep North Americans from teaching English Europe.  The good old days are gone, replaced with aggressive border police who are looking for ESL teachers to arrest and deport.  Many English schools in Prague, for example, are complaining bitterly against Schengen, because the companies they teach English at want Americannot BritishEnglish teachers.  Further: if you are staying over 30 days on vacation in Europe you will be treated like a criminal because of Schengen: you only get 30 days to visit Europe...then you must GET OUT: or, you must get a travel visa for every single European country you are visiting.  So, for Europeans Schengen may be nice, but for foreigners it is HORRIBLE.  I hate Schengen, and I hate the EU government in Brussels.  What a bunch of fucking assholes!!!

PROVE THAT SHIT!\\n\\nHe stated in this post to Wikipedia that his book Battle Neverending’s 3 thousand copies sold out in one year which is a total lie. He printed them in 1998 and was still selling them as recent as 2006\\n\\nhttp://www.popocculture.com/28/battle-neverending-by-saab-l\\n\\n“Jarvis Marlow is the man who paid out of his own pocket for the second printing (one thousand copies) and third printing (two thousand copies) of Battle Neverending. I sold all three thousand copies of Btl Nvrg within the span of a year”. \\n\\n(Example #1 of his lies)\\n\\n2000 copies of A.D. supposedly sold in one year or as Saab states (Record Time) which is also unverifiable whether it actually sold that fast since he out an out lied about Battle Neverendings.\\nThe first A.D. was published by a small defunct anarchist publisher which describes itself as publishing \"\"pamphlets\"\", sold out and was not reprinted.\\n\\n“However, his claim to fame is the novel he wrote while still in the dorms at San Francisco State University, A.D., which was so radical a book it got him kicked out of college in 1997.”\\n\\nWhen in reality\\n\\n“Lofton wrote \"\"A.D.\"\" while a student at San Francisco State University and spent so much time hawking the book when it was published three years ago that his grades began to fall and the university cut off his financial aid”.\\n\\n(Example #2 of his lies)\\n\\nI ‘m not admitting any mistake about BERKELEY (you always want to appear very radical so I’m sure you told him you were homeless on the streets of Berkeley) because you made that up as well as being homeless! The only place you’ve been homeless was on your mothers couch for THREE YEARS ALL THE WHILE REFUSING TO WORK A DAY JOB, IM SURE TO YOUR MOTHERS AMAZEMENT ON JUST HOW MUCH OF A BUM HER SON TURNED OUT TO BE!\\n\\n(Example #3 of his lies)\\n\\n“In all the WEEKS you\\'ve been STALKING me, NOT ONE motherfucker has so much as e-mailed me and asked, \"\"is this anonymous, psuedonym-using piece of shit correct about anything?\"\"”.\\n\\nI know nobody reads your shit anyway so I wouldn’t expect any response. I write these things simply because I know that you can’t handle risking your supposed fame! (Which is all you are interested in anyway). Your not an activist you’re an opportunist masking yourself in anarchy.\\n\\nAnd finally I have this victory over your Racist Spoiled Black Privileged ass!\\n\\nHere’s the dialog about shutting Saabs Wikepedia page because firstly it’s chalked full of made up shit and secondly they finally realize that he’s just another home publishing hack!\\n\\nI\\'ve looked into the books listed in the bibliography... The first was published by a small defunct anarchist publisher which describes itself as publishing \"\"pamphlets\"\", sold out and was not reprinted. The second was described by Pop Occulture Magazine as \"\"obviously a low-budget and quite-possibly home-printed affair\"\". There is no evidence that either of these books received a credible review, much less meet WP:BOOK. Journalists are a dime-a-dozen and not automatically notable, and these books don\\'t appear to establish notability either.\\n\\nTherefore I am proposing deletion of the article.

They are angry first so I know they are suffering enough and would only poke at them some more just to annoy them (sound fimiliar?) I give them their space though I would still do what I did/do to annoy them. Except, I do it without coming into contact with them (as they would do to me) which I know we\\'d both appreciate.\\n\\nI keep the sitch isolated someone else doesn\\'tblow the entire thing out of proportion before me and that person can resolve the matter only with each other which is inevitable. Others can\\'t resolve the problem, only make it bigger and more serious for either 1 or both. see below.\\n\\nIf they ever try to apologize I tell them not to→ because I wouldn\\'t→ because I have no reason to→ because we shouldn\\'t have been in a scrabble no if ands or buts about it.

You (blindly) follow invalid rules and principles that completely misinterpret the act and are constantly showing how much shit they\\'re full of.\\n\\n2. You think you got \"\"human psychology\"\" in the bag and have tried to play from this to class your principles into rules but your system is far outdated and very inhumane.\\n\\n3. You don\\'t want to and try not to link yourselves and articles with POV(point of views) but little have you realized your entire system thrives apon it. \\nYou take sides in arguments between users based solely on what YOU think is most right based apon how YOU have been taught what is right. You are NO ONE to interpret what \"\"mad\"\", \"\"kind\"\", \"\"eccentric\"\", ect. is. Just another group of the bunch and they all think seperately on subjects or else we\\'d look and be exactly the same. And you don\\'t want that. \\nAnd don\\'t you tell me to calm down, I get just the opposite when people try to make me look crazy that way, and it certainly isn\\'t any diffen\\'t with Bots. \\n\\n4. Most importantly, you robots are full of shit:\\nYou take leaders/favorites→ who take favorites→ who put up with your shit like its the right thing to do because they don\\'t knowwhat else to do. Sickening.\\n\\n2a. You abuse your power instead of embracing it\\'s enlightenment.\\nDon\\'t you get it?! He wasn\\'t going to block me himself because he wanted to toy with me. He knew I knew he was higher than me and could just as easily waved a hand and blocked me himself. But he didn\\'t.

They want to be someone powerful so they can feel embraced/in. \\nWe all want what we shouldn\\'t have. \\nUnfortunately, there are some of us who already have what we shouldn\\'t have.\\n\\n5. How you go about it is the wrong way. \\nSome things people must learn for themselves. You have a problem, try relying on yourself and no one else to resolve.  \\nIf some people are fighting with each other over the internet just sit back and let them/butt out and leave them to their bickering. Sooner or later they will stop arguing of their own account/or reasoning. Or they may even just \"\"stop\"\".

I am not surprised that the leftists don't care as they have shown no dicipline for allowing information contrary to their own beliefs.  Even the most insane excuses are accepted by them.\\n\\nSaying these this behavior is idiotic or stupid is reasonable given the fact that this material is deleted because Canderra believes the sources to be blogs.  Not one source is a blog.  The New York Sun, USA Today, Frontpage Magazine, Florida International University, History News Network, and the Independent Research Institute...ARE NOT BLOGS.  Canderra is just making up excuses to delete information he does not like and the leftists sycophants are working to have me blocked while ignoring Canderra's (and others) abuses.  (Gibby )\",\n",

       " array([\"First problem ParacusForward like most wiki editors you don't understand the subject but wiki functions like a micropedia if they want more information the real people's encyclopaediais called Google. Either you don't understand the problems of getting past the big brother police state of Manipur where people are terrified to report the truth or you don't care. I thought perhaps this might be a place to release info but I noticed the spike in info came from reports available via google. One national tv company followed by a local newspaper broke the story on the death threats and hate mail. Then the gangsters responded in an Indian national tabloid. Now they are trying to put the djinn back into the bottle. I don't think you are necessarily malicious the police and security forces wouldn't have to pay you to supress the truth. You are clearly racist or if you prefer the more encylopaediac term ethnocentric. One of the sources the only one I saw that was completely incorrect is a Chinese Government Human Rights Agency. They are not so hot on Tibet and can be truthful on non chinese human rights abuses but in Manipur they have close links with the major human rights NGO which has long been run by the local police. I am sure things will happen but since you haven't got any interest in updating it none will report it here. I don't believe it is helpful either. Wiki did not allow the 24 hours grace to support to keep my fiancee alive again not out of malice but because of aspergers syndrome. I am sending her Hard Times if you haven't read it Wiki does a good summary they are also good for things like definition of satyagraha but for up to date info Google is the first port of call or Twitter. So anyway good luck with your project but the manner in which a few ignorant racist wiki editors claim ownership of this venture with nobody else having the courage to challenge them in case they too are red handed by a confederacy of dunces will make it less relevant. It is far from accurate or up to date. Mainly because editors like you do not have sufficient background understanding of hte politics and culture of the articles you edit. Before I began editing wiki hadn't updated info for several years. No doubt now you will accept unchallenged the false government reports which because they carry the weight of Chinese Propaganda agencies and local newspapers wholly intimidated by the Manipur State and corrupt police will now stand unchallenged by the editors who look only at code grammar and syntax and have no understanding of hte problems of truth reporting from within a police state of the third world. Idiots like you will also complain how your own press are not independent.\",\n",

Then he argued with and ultimately attacked Pcap, the editor who reverted the vandalism. Then Pcap, presumably out of frustration, asked me for help, as I was the one who had provided most of the original text for that article.  I am not active much anymore on wikipedia, so I mostly just I commiserated on Pcap's talk page. I told him I would not get involved. (Why am I not active? Because there are too many assholes like User:Aboutmovies allowed to run free, making life shitty for everyone.)  \\n\\nNow Mr. User:Aboutmovies, apparently having too much time on his hands, snoops through my personal communications on Pcap's talk page. And so, after putting his nose where it doesn't belong, he gets his nose out of whack, and comes to my personal talk page, and attacks me. Why? This guy clearly owed Pcap an apology. He could have offered an apology. He could have quietly slunk off with his tail between his legs, and repented in private. No, instead of doing the right, honorable thing, he instead chooses to attack me. (So who is escalating? He is.) So I called him an asshole, which he richly deserves. So then he escalates some more: he gets you to block me.  You were sucked right into his game.  You did not bother to do any due diligence. AT ALL. You should have blocked him, not me.  Once you realized your mistake, which Pcap points out to you above, you could have offered me an apology, turned around, and blocked Aboutmovies instead. Did you bother to do any of these things? No.  You fucked up.\\n\\nSo to summarize: Fuck off tedder. You are part of the problem, and not part of the solution.

       " array([\"And now for some... amusement \\n\\nAfter all the times you have thwarted me... After all the times my plans for world domination were foiled by your meddlesome interference... After all the countless times you escaped at the very last moment, finally, I, Butros The Mighty, have defeated you, Crum375, Space Commander From Swalwell! \\nHow long I have awaited this glorious triumph! The Emperor Of The Universe has secured his dominion on this day! And now that my long struggle is over, how about a little... amusement?\\nWith a clap of my jewel-bedecked hands, I summon the scantily clad dancing girls of my Pan-Galactic Slave-Harem. \\nI have destroyed your accursed vessel, Star Of Abuse III, and melted it into slag, from which the galaxy's greatest artisans have forged a grand, towering statue... of me! A statue even larger and grander than the one you toppled, pinning me under its plinth, the day you nearly destroyed my Throne Room! The statue stands here in the Grand Ballroom of my Great Celestial Palace, covered in a gigantic space-tarp, but not so fast, Crum, we are not yet ready for the grand unveiling. \\nI have captured the traitorous Princess Angela and her rebel allies from the Spaceship Tax Evader and immobilized them in geo-stationary orbit above my palace. At the merest touch of a button, I can activate the Astro-Detonator and delight the assembled billions here with a fireworks display the likes of which the great Butronian Empire has never seen! Princess Angela may be my own daughter, but that will not stop me from turning her and her fellow Wiki-lovers into space-dust. Even now, helplessly strapped into titanium space-manacles, they witness all I say and do on the Projecto-Screen of the Gallant. Hello, my fair daughter. How does it feel to lay eyes once again on your own... DOOM?\\nHa ha ha ha ha!\\nSee how I have seized your puny Earth friends, your boob-lover helper Guy Chapman and boy sidekick Jayjg? They too shall be forced to look on as I gorge in ecstasy at your failure and destroy your planet! Even now, I can see they long for me to discharge the Fang-Creatures of Carnivoron into their glass-walled prison, thus releasing them from the agony of witnessing my victory... But no! First, they will watch you writhe in defeat!\\nAnd that is not all, Crum! Surely, even slung in your titanium chains above the Flames Of Hate, you can see that to my right I have, held at Blasto-Ray-point by my Robo-Legionnaires, bound and displayed for all to see... Jimbo Wales and his Rocket Squad! Repturova, the Talurnian walking-lizard spy who betrayed me by joining you! Weissus, commander of the Valkyrie War-Jet Platoon! And last but not least... your beloved Julian Van August!\\nAnd now, with the merest wave of my Hypno-Scepter... Watch as your darling Earth friend tumbles under my spell. DANCE! Dance for my amusement! Let the sight of your seductively writhing body, contorting itself for my viewing pleasure, be the last thing Crum sees before she is lowered into the Flames! \\nTears?! Do I see tears in the eyes of the brave Crum375, also kown as Linda Mack? Oh-ho! Even I, in my most sinister, depraved dreams, would never have imagined it!\\nDANCE FOR MY AMUSEMENT! NEH-HEH heh-heh-heh-heh! HA HAHAHAHA!\\nHow glorious! At last, with trumpet fanfare from my Astro-Orchestra, I order the curtain raised from my statue and...WHAT?!! ... It's a newly rebuilt Star Of Abuse IV! And who is that emerging from the gangplank? Crum, herelf?! \\nNO! \\nBuddy Jayjg has activated a hidden radio signal! The Rocket Squad is bursting free and shrinking my Robo-Legionnaires into nothing with Transmut-O-Bracelets concealed in their manacles! Weissus swings his mighty Space-Mace, smashing the controls to my torturous devices! My Hypno-Scepter, forced from my grasp by Prince Kazak's Magneto-Shooto-Beam! Julian Van August, running free into the awaiting arms of... CRUM?\\nThen, who is the prisoner suspended above the Flames Of Hate? What? Emitting the telltale sparks and ear-smoke of an android double? Drat! It's nothing more than a simple robo-mannequin decoy! \\nAiyeee! The Spaceship Gallant, with Princess Angela at the helm, is dive-bombing the Great Celestial Palace! Billowing clouds of space-smoke! Crowds running everywhere! Kaff! I'm choking! Kaff, kaff! Victory has—kaff—slipped through my fingers—kaff, kaff!—once again! Kaff, kaff!—CURSE YOU, CRUM kaff 375! Kaff! CURSE kaff YOU kaff FOREVER! Kaff, kaff, kaff, kaff...\\n\\nTHE END\",\n",

Obviosuly the admin in question and I have not seen eye to eye on the talk page of an extreemly controversial subject.  According to that policy he should have mentioned his intent to block me the admin notification board to let the other admins know prior top blocking me.  He did not do that.  He also is obligated to provide me with some specifics which he did not do.  And \"\"Final warning\"\" suggests a previous warning had been given.  I would not be shocked if all my comments here get deleted and he uses WP:Soapbox as an excuse.  Oh well, what are you gonna do.  The only thing that bothers me is I cannot post anything on any of the admin boards to get a question or two answered and I cannot post on NCDave\\'s talk page (he would appreciate the irony here I think).  He also deleted my comments on the talk page yet he leaves dozens of actual viscous attacks done by others there, I attacked no one so this selective enforcement makes me smile too.   I suspect the \"\"batman\"\" comment sent him over the top (I\\'m Batman).  But we have one guy claiming he\\'s a nuclear scientists and therefore evolution is wrong, another guy (who this Night dude is demonstrably sympathetic too) who claims he\\'s a doctor and has proven evolution to be false, so I figured letting the cat out of the bag and admitting I\\'m batman was just as relevant (shhh mum\\'s the word, my wife would kill me if she knew I was a crime fighter).  The talk page is obviously not a place for people to claim they can/have proven evolution to be wrong nor is it a good place to appeal to one\\'s own authority.  But, in Nightguy\\'s eyes I guess you can claim you\\'re a nuclear scientist but claiming to be batman somehow violates some policy. \\n\\nTo be clear, I\\'m seeing this as idiotically funny and not ranting against admins or Wikipedia.  Anyhow, here\\'s to appreciating the occassional absurdity in life!  19:15\"',\n",

First the blogosphere and then Wikipedia itself lit up with news of his messy breakup with controversial Canadian TV pundit Rachel Marsden. Now, accusations are flying that Wales has been living the high life on the expense account of the nonprofit foundation he created.\\nOn Friday, reports surfaced that the married-but-divorcing Internet icon carried on a clandestine affair with Marsden.  Evidence of the affair included lurid IM transcripts, which appeared on Silicon Valley gossip blog Valleywag. On Saturday, Wales posted a statement on the Wikipedia Foundations website (which he later moved to his personal site) denying that his actions went against Wikimedia Foundation\\'s policies, and stating that the affair had ended. Marsden responded by listing the clothes that he left at her house up for auction on eBay.\\nSo, what\\'s the big deal when a relationship goes sour? Well, the two met when Marsden contacted Wales to help her \"\"clean up\"\" what she perceived to be errors on her personal Wikipedia page, and there have been allegations that Wales used his influence to improperly make changes.\\nFormer associates of Wales\\' are using this scandal to bring up other worries they have about the organization of the foundation. Former Wikimedia exec Danny Wool, who left the foundation last year, wrote a blog post insinuating that Wales used the non-profit foundation as his own personal piggy bank. Expenses that Wales tried to apply to the foundation included $300+ bottles of wine and visits to Moscow massage parlors, Wool alleges. According to Wool, the expenses got so out of hand that the Wikimedia foundation took away Wales\\' corporate credit card.\\n\"\"There were occasions where he used [the Wikimedia Foundation] for personal advancement under the guide of the mission.  And, as someone who was in there for the mission part of it, I found that rather distressful,\"\" Wool told EPICENTER.\\nWales did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\"',\n",

Those who blocked me ARE IN THE POCKET OF BIG COAL AND I EXPOSED THEIR NEFARIOUS plots. Please FREE KINGSHOWMAN!\"\" \\n\\nDon\\'t Wikipedia editors catch obvious attempts at humour? Perhaps you didn\\'t find them funny, but they were meant as attempts at levity during the heated so-called \"\"Coal Wars\"\". I was also not entirely alone in the position I took there on coal which was simply that a paragraph needed to be added to the lead to reflect Coal\\'s Health and Environmental Effects. I wasn\\'t taking an unreasonable position, and you will now see, that thanks to my tireless, thankless efforts to improve this encylopedia, that information is now in the lead on Coal. (not through reverts by me, but by others who agreed with my position.) I have not edited coal since my block, so I\\'m not quite sure how it makes sense to blocvk me again for something that I haven\\'t gone back to doing.\\n\\nAlso, I did not harrass Flyer22. She harrassed me. May I relate the course of events,  which you may verify? First of all, I stopped communicating with her since she requested that I do so. Second of all, she got steamed because I added a paragraph on Nietzsche to her \"\"Happiness\"\" article under the section \"\"Philsoophy of Happiness.\"\" Arguably (as other editors agreed) Nietzsche may have something valuable to say here, and I very quiickly made a summary of the SEP article on Nietzsche\\'s moral philosophy on this topic. No, it wasn\\'t perfect and the referencing could have used improvement, but it was better than omitting it and leaving readers with a somewhat one-sided impression of the Great Philosophers on Happiness. Flyer22 reverted my edit, giving a basically spurious reason: \"\"Unsourced\"\" as I recall. But it was directed to THE MOST RELIABLE source on Philosophy, by general and academic consensus, the SEP. It would in fact be very easy to improve a great deal of Wiki Philosophy articles by just having editors sum up information from this wonderful free, peer-reviewed, academically rigorous resource.\\n\\nThen, withouit provocation, after I asked her what exactly she found problematic about including Nietzsche in a list of philosophers who have written about Happiness, including similar statured luminaries like Augustine, Aquinas, Aristotle, Mill, etc. she responded, not by listing what was wrong with my Happiness edit, but by telling me \"\"ALL OF YOUR EDITS ARE POOR, PURE AND SIMPLE. YOU ARE A POOR EDITOR.\"\" I thought this was rather rude and ignorant, especfially as she saw fit to specifically attack my Hume edits (when Hume was not under discussion) telling me \"\"your edits on Hume largely consit of such (read=poor) edits and I\\'m tempted to revert them.\"\" Since I hate to see a poor soul suffering under the weight of such crushing temptation, I gave in to the temptation myself, and deleted all of my contributions from this encylopedia. Within hours, a throng of rebellion began to emerge,. a grass-roots protest movement which demanded the immediate return of all the much-loved Kingshowman edits to the encylopedia. Editors rushed to my defense. I told Flyer22 to eat crow and admit that, contra her opinion, my Hume edits and contributions to this beloved tome of knowledge were not so poor after all. She declined and escalated her attacks. She was the one who harrassed me, and I thought we were done with this sordid little episode until she popped back up, eager to participate in the latest round of mob justice.   Kingshowman\"',\n",

But this constant BITCHING and whining about political correctness has gone too far. You CANNOT change the Canadian national anthem because it is insulting \"\"immigrants\"\". They\\'re IMMIGRANTS, they CHOSE to come to Canada, and it should be that they should respect OUR traditions -though keeping their customs and traditions, I have nothing against multiculturalism-. We cannot bend over backwards for people who have done nothing for the country! It\\'s like subjecting to bullying, it\\'s not bloody right! And the usage of \"\"God\"\" and \"\"son\"\" means nothing! It\\'s a traditional piece. I am an atheist, and an agnostic, yet I have no objection to prayer in my school\\'s chapel, to singing Christian lyrics, because it pertains no meaning to me. Are not God, Jesus, Allah, Mohammed, Buddha, and ANY other religious deity supposed to all be working for the same cause? Should not they all be \"\"friends\"\"??? SO may I ask WHAT is the problem with the Canadian anthem? Allah, Jesus, Mohammed, Buddha and God are all manifestations of the SAME PERSON, THING, CAUSE, REASON! The Canadian anthem is traditional, and it seems to me almost a sacrilege (if you may excuse the poor choice of word, as it seems to contradict my whole speech!) to complain about it being sexist, or bigotry. This ties in with the controversy over the Queen. She is a testament to the tradition of Canada, to remove her would be to follow in the footsteps of the United States. We are not Yanks, we are members of the commonwealth. To get back on track, I state clearly, there is absolutely no logical, moral or respectful way that it can be stated to change the lyrics to a traditional song! A song is a song. You cannot opt to change the lyrics to a controversial popular song, like \"\"The Beatles\"\"! You just don\\'t do it! So HOW should it be the same for the anthem? The anthem represents what Canada is. It was established as Christian, and though we gladly accept other cultures, we cannot change every damn thing to be politically correct for all the minorities out there. It\\'s IMPOSSIBLE. Freedom of speech has become the opposite. Comedians can\\'t make jokes about religion, sexuality, gender without being complained at, reprimanded at by minorities. Australia is a perfect example of how a country should be run. They say to immigrants: \"\"You make the choice to live here. That means you have to live with the way Australians live, Australian code, Australian traditions. Don\\'t come here expecting us to change just for you.\"\" This is how a country should be.

Nope, that's far too much like work for that lazy prick.\\n\\nThis change of identity is being covered up by Elen on the grounds of OUTing. Yes, that's right, Elen wants to stake her reputation on a patently ridiculous claim that knowing that Mo ainm is really a bloke called Duncan who lives in Ireland, is a violation of WP:OUTING, just to cover up the fact that she never bothered to verify whether this was 100% grade A bullshit before she started blocking people for calling it as such, those who were there at the beginning and know just exactly how this lucky cunt came to have this excuse land in his lap and save him from a complete FAIL in understanding what is and is not a CLEANSTART.\\n\\nSo here we are, with sponge brained morons like Reaper and detestible assholes like BWilkins continuing the farce with blocks and censures like this.

Assuming neither of you has the backbone to do the necessary and end this farce once and for all by calling Elen out on her lies, one of you has to now ensure this post gets oversighted so she can continue this OUTing bullshit story of hers to cover her own incompetent deceitful ass.

I did not see that you had blocked me until, few days later the block had expired, I came to your talk page, and saw that you had said that you had blocked me.\\nIn addition, by not communicating me that I was blocked, you did not allow me to ask other admins to review my block.\\nThe reasons why you did it:\\nIt is not stated anywhere in this Wikipedia that an user cannot remove stuff from his talk page.\\nYou neither told me not to remove that stuff.\\nI accepted and fulfilled your request of having a civil attitude. Ignoring what I had done before (which was not much), since the moment you told me that, I kept a civil attitude.\\nI also lost my time coming here to reply you, so there is no possible way to say that I ignored your request.\\nIn all, your block was just full of irregularities. It was not a normal admin block, but rather a thoughtless decission that you took without following any kind of procedure. You just decided that I had to be blocked because you might think that removing the civility warning that you had posted in my talk page was some kind of lack of respect towards you. But it is frankly stupid to think that way, because of the reasons I\\'ve explained above.\\nAnd since you realized that you had comitted an enormous mistake, that you had used your admin powers despotically, you just repeatedly ignored the requests that I did to you in your own talk page, where I asked you why had you blocked me (this one, and this one), adding to your unjustified attitude towards me, a high grade of arrogance.\\nIn addition, you are threatening me. Read well what I wrote:\\n\"\"Hello? Why did you block me? Since when removing a civility warning from one\\'s talk page is something that deserves a block? You did not even communicate my block to my talk page. I am stil waiting for a justification of your abusive attitude as admin. You not only block for no reason but you also ignore people\\'s requests of justification!\"\".\\nWhere do you see a lack of respect here? Where do you see that I \"\"keep\"\" an uncivil attitude? Honestly, you are the one being uncivil: \"\"if you carry on in the line you are takng, you will be blocked again\"\" ... which line I am takng? And why do you threaten me? \"\"If you do not wish to contribute constructively to the encyclopedia, then we shall make sure that you do not prevent others from contributing\"\" ... oh, \"\"we\"\". This sounds to me more like a street gang threatening a poor pedestrian, than an admin giving wise advices to a poor Wikipedian. Go to my user page and see the articles I\\'ve created. Isn\\'t that a positive contribution?\\nLook: I am not being uncivil; it is you, the one being disrespectful with me. And I am not ignoring your requests of being civil; I am fulfilling them. And it is rather you, who are not only ignoring my requests of justification for the actions you carried out against me, but also threatening me with new repressive measures.  \"',\n",

So on this point, my vote is not necessarily inconsistent (34,900 > 19,000).\\nWell, sure, but that\\'s weak\"\"35000 is notable, but 19000 isn\\'t\"\". Come on. That\\'s not serious.\\n\\nBut even if you had 50,000 hits on Google, I might also have refrained from voting. This is mainly because I am concerned about you putting so much pressure to have your own article. If I was in your position, I would probably keep my distance from the discussion. You are a primary source of information for yourself and, in that sense, your position might be biased. I am not sure whether your attitude fits with the Neutral point of view policy (which applies to articles, but probably also to the way the encyclopedia should be created as a whole). I don\\'t know, and I prefer to abstain from the vote.\\nUnderstandable, and advice well taken and appreciated. But I am a justice seeker. I really don\\'t care as much if my entry is deleted or not, as for whether I fight to vindicate my unfair treatment (as I perceive it). Here I was, many moon ago, minding my own damn business, and someone tells me I have a Wiki entry. Interesting. Then someone says it\\'s up for delete. What do I care. I really don\\'t give a damn. But some jerk says it\\'s non-notable (okay by meI didn\\'t konw Wiki policies on this at the time anyway); and vanity. Implying I did it, as self-promotion. This pissed me off. I rebutted the latter charge and did not even mention the notable charge. Later, many months later, someone tells me he has initiated VfD for Palmer\\'s site. Now this was right after the Wiki entries of some CLEARLY notable friends of mine were vandalizedHans-Hermann Hoppe, Lew Rockwell with ridiculous charges of racism etc., of the same type made by Palmer. So I figure, let\\'s take a look at his entry. I did so, and in the ensuing VfD debate, realize there are actual policies on this; I studied them and thought, \"\"son of a bitch. I qualify. By their own policies. These wikinerds should not have deleted me. And to top it off, the same one who voted to delete me is voting to keep Palmer. Something ain\\'t right.\"\" So, instead of dishonestly putting up my entry anonymously or through a meatpuppet, I did it myself, nothing hidden. And instead of rolling over and playing dead as I did last time, I decided this time, I will make noise and make sure that if I have anything ot say about it, the voters will be made aware of the policies. That is all. If a fair evaluation of my site and aplication of the policies leads to a good faith vote to delete my entry, I don\\'t care. But what do I see? Peopel who vote to keep Palmer up on the grounds that he is openly gay, or has a large number of publications, or has 13000 google hits, voting to delete me, even though I have similar criteria. It makes it seem arbitrary to me. So can you blame me for monitoring this a little bit, and being a bit frustrated at the seemingly arbitrary actions of some people? Nom.  \\n\\n\"',\n",

Repeating the same old 19th century out of date fallacies in a modern book does not constitute evidence or substantiation. The only differnece between modern linguists repitition of these fallacies and the original is that the modern linguists have removed all of the racist slurs from the original work (well most of them anyway) and have included the disclaimer that none of the nonsense they are regurgitating is provable given the historical evidence, or rather the complete lack of it, and modern research which is unanimously against the theory.

Chrys C. Caragounis is a linguistics expert and a philologist and is thus a valid source. Development of Greek and the New Testament, Mohr Siebeck (ISBN 3161482905) is his most recent publication a probable the most recent research on ancient Greek pronunciation in existence. Anyone claiming to be an expert in ancient Greek that still believes in the reconstructed pronunciation has no right to be called an expert since it is like believing in the Ptolemaic Earth centred universe which observations have shown to be wrong. All of the experts in Semitic linguistics are against the reconstructed pronunciation of ancient Greek since they make it perfectly clear that ancient Greek was pronounced like modern Greek at the time the Septuagint was translated from the original Hebrew in 280 BC. This therefore implies that classical Greek must have been pronounced like modern Greek as well otherwise 72 Hebrew expert who were taught ancient Greek as children 50 years earlier would not have associated the proto-Semitic fricative gimel in Gomorra which was no longer used in the written language but was only spoken as a breath with the Greek letter gamma. Gamma therefore must have been fricative and there a myriads of other examples that Semitic linguists use to show that ancient Greek was pronounced like modern Greek and that the Hebrew alphabet represented the mediae and dasea and z as fricatives. It is clear from the study of Semitic linguistics and from experts in the filed like Caragounis and Papadimitrakopulos that the reconstructed pronunciation is a racist sham based on Germanic supremacy (as can be seen from the slurs in the papers of is original creators) and an affront to science and the only reason why it is still being tangut is for ethnocentric reasons alone.',\n",

Do you need citations that dogs did not decend thousands of years ago from the wolves that are alive today, as most people believe? Do I need proof that they decended thousands of years ago from the wolves that LIVED thousands of years ago? Why does this need citation? Is this your problem? I am merely pointing out the error that so many, many people make. They hear that dogs decended from wolves, and they look around and see the only wolves left in the world in any number today are the wolves of northern lattitudes...they see the grey wolf of northern Eursaia and the timber wolf of North America, and believe that all dogs decended from them. Humans are a tropical creature that moved into the colder regions. Everywhere man goes, wolf populations dwindle, as anybody knows, and in ancient times, before man, there were wolves all over the world, adapted to their own climates. What part of this needs citation? Obviously, the first dogs to be bred were the ones where the people first lived, which is obviously the warmer climates, and it was THESE wolves that gave rise to most of our dog breeds, not the northern wolves. Now the wolves of the colder regions are the only ones left in number, the wolves in warmer places, where dogs were first bred, are almost all gone. Some northern breeds decended from northern wolves, yes. The spitz breeds and sled dogs, etc. This is all so obviuous, can you tell me what part of this you don't understand, and need citations about? I feel like I am talking to a child. If I tell my child that George Washington was the first president, to I have to give a citation? This stuff doesn't need citation.\\n\\nYou are a vandal, because you, as the only person on earth who doesn't agree with this, erased three whole paragraphs, not once but twice, on the grounds that there were no references, even though much larger tracts of the article are more controvertial and have no citations. You erased every word I wrote, even though all of it is true, none of it is controversial, and this is nothing but pure vandalism.\\n\\nYou need citation that dogs interbreed with coyotes? Why? How can you not already know that? How is this possible? And articles about the Russian jackal-dog hybrid are all over the web. Can you use a search engine? Look up the pre-caudal gland in any veterinary text. Things that are controvertial or new need citations to the new or controvertial sources, but when something become so widely-known that it can be found in every reference work out there, it no longer needs specific citation. For anything I wrote, you can look it up in Britannica. If you read something that you did not know, it doesn't mean the author needs to cite references for you, it just means you need to do your own homework. I am merely pointing out the things that are such a big part of common knowledge, and using them to prove that dogs did not all decend entirely from modern wolves of the colder climate where people didn't even live when dogs were first domesticated. In all my years of veterinary practice, I have probably told 100's of my patients that dogs decended from warm-climate wolves, NOT all of them come from the northern wolves. Now, after all these years, I am confronted by a web vandal who tells me I have to cite freaking references about this. It is purely annoying. \\n\\nIf you erase my writings again I will report you as a vandal. Really, do NOT do it again.\\n\\nMorgan Wright\",\n",

You have 'not proved' anything. On the contrary, you have only proved that you are assuming 1/3 = 0.333... which it is obviously 'not equal'. 0.333... is an 'indeterminate' number because it cannot be represented finitely in base 10. \\n0.333... is not equal to 1/3 so you cannot say that 1/3 is a finite representation. An indeterminate number is a number that is repeating in any\\nradix system.\\n\\nYou mention the division algorithm but do you know what it says? The division algorithm has 'nothing' to do with radix systems. Let me state it for you - If a and b are two given integers, there are unique integers q and r\\nsuch that a=bq + r and  0<= r < b. Now I will use the division algorithm to prove that you are WRONG once and for all. Suppose a = 1 and b = 0.999..., then \\nwhat are the integers q and r such that the above is true?\\n\\nSuppose that q = 0 and r = 1. Then the division algorithm fails because it makes a false statement i.e. q and r can both be 0 and 1 respectively.\\nFor example: 1 = (0.999...)(1)+0 and 1 = (0.999...)(0)+1. So by default, the\\ndivision algorithm is proved false if 0.999... is equal to 1. And you can say a lot of things about the Greeks, but they would not make a stupid mistake like this. They were the smartest race in ancient times.\\n\\nNow suppose that you try to tell me that either form is acceptable in the case of 0 and 1, you will still end up with a terrible contradiction:\\n\\n1=(0.999...)(0)+1. The second form in this case implies that 1 < 0.999... since r < b. But how can 1 be less than 0.999... ??!!\\n\\nI want the world to know what f..g idiots run this site.

       " array(['\"\\n\\n WIKIPEDIA IS COMMUNISM!!!! \\n\\nIt had been six years since we had graduated from college, and for the first time since graduation, all three of us were together again. From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.\\n\\nHaving returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.\\n\\nAs I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine\\'s skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.\\n\\nThe conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. As in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. Beth\\'s black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine.\\n\\nIt felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.\\n\\nThe intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. An arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. My eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.\\n\\nNo words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters. But eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. I stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.\\n\\nI awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee, faint yet unmistakable. Justine was gone, clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar, while Beth and I held each other as she slept. The feel of her pajama-covered breasts against me was a welcome sensation, as it h',\n",

On the other hand, such users do find it appropriate to throw in pictures using the Turkish and the ILLEGAL, yes illegal according to United Nation referendums flat of the non-recognised internationally illegal self-proclaimed state of the so-called TRNC.\\n\\nIt is totally UNACCEPTABLE to have extremist nationalistic individuals, that strategically reached the level of administrators, deteriorating all the time the article on the city of Nicosia, promoting an unrealistic Turkish character and undermining the Greek character of the city AND at the same time having an ADDITIONAL article on \"\"North Nicosia\"\" that is depicting a totally FALSE picture w.r.t the city. The TRNC is illegal, not recognised by any state other than Turkey and some terrorist states that are non-democratic and yet Wikipedia has a page on Northern Nicosia by supposedly administrators that support the unification of Cyprus. This is clearly a major distortion of their intentions and a huge lie in that an individual that pretends to be a neutral aribtrator and a supoporter of reunification cannot have a separate page on Northern Nicosia stressing how Turkish it is and then go and literally destroy everything in the proper page for Nicosia and emphasize the Turkish character of the city, talk about the tension and the division of the city all the time and undermine the Greek character.\\n\\nThis is clear nationalistic and racial discrimination against the indisputable Greek character of the area controlled by the Republic of Cyprus and furthermore it is downgrading for the Republic of Cyprus the mere fact that Wikipedia has a site that is CONSTANTLY vandalised by several ethnic Turkish extremists and Wikipedia users support such discriminatory behaviour.\\n\\nIn the light of all of this, I shall stop contributing to Wikipedia as I consider it downgrading for my own self. Furthermore, I do not wish to participate in an \"\"encyclopedic\"\" project that is totally biased and discriminatory.\\n\\nMarcobadotti (talk) \"',\n",

       " array([\"Honestly the way wiki is treating this is a JOKE\\n\\na. I could have cited NEWS SITES but since when is a news site worthy of an academic cite?\\n\\nb. if the person that wanted PEER REVIEW felt like it, he would have sought it 20 years ago, HE CHOSE NOT TO DO IT, but none the less his work is known and was mentioned in many math related 'forums' and most ignored it. \\n\\nc. Only the recent 2012 open source test of the work PROVED the 30Mod algorithm is a major thing in math, again, GITHUB is a programmers resource and it was not until a computer used the actual 30Mod algorithm that it was shown to be a 'big thing' and since then some news sites have covered it, but I chose not to cite them due to IMO they are not NPOV. But none the less they covered the story.\\n\\nd. The FACT is a major computer site where programmers have free reign to challenge any claims exists and for over two years not one programmer challenged the findings.\\n\\ne. so what if the person that discovered it works outside of academia and has no regard for normal 'peer review' the fact is he has no peers if you ask some in academia that know of his work, and I am one of those people that know of the work and how brilliant the work is.\\n\\nNow to summarize, we have a bunch of pags about primes on wiki, and even pages created after his discovery that USE his discovery (ie. the sieve of Atkin 60Mod work is his work discussed in the public forum and usenet math and physics forums is where he chose to discuss his amazing work.\\n\\nSo now you have 2004 sieve of Atkin using a 60Mod algorithm, guess what that was in his 1995 paper. So does wiki acknowledge that? No. And i didn't even bother to waste my time of the 60 mod algorithm since the big deal as you are saying is the PyPrimes test and I cited that very well, it's a program created in Python, I cited the wiki python page, then I cited Github for both PyPrimes and the PyPrimes testing.\\n\\nNow while MATH is m forte, I am sufficient enough in computer skills to understand what Github is and to understand how to read the speed tests and the prime spirals smoked every algorithm there is. Now anyone can download python (which I have done) and download pyprimes (which I have done) and run the tests. Guess what just like a math experiment, it is duplicated.\\n\\nSo GITHUB and the tests which are not 'new' should be enough to begin a wiki page on this truly amazing discovery in math.\\n\\nI myself became aware of the first paper in 1995, as did others in aademia. Recently I became aware of 'news sites' running stories citing what I copied, the links to the Github tests.\\n\\nWhile some here can say well it's not AMA, so what, in the world of primality testing primes spirals as per the PyPrimes results shows PRIME SPIRALS are a big deal.\\n\\nNow I tried to be NPOV in giving all sides of the story, Adoni has a valid 1995 claim I can verify it and I chose not to. But I cited a Drexel Math forum and I could have cited many other math sites discussing his 30mod, 60mod and 90mod prime work in the 1990's. Is this signficant? You bet it is since 60Mod prime sieve aka Atkin sieve is 20004 so his 60mod prime work is well before it.\\n\\nNow the Github tests mentions 'croft spirals', that's due to in 2010 a person named croft registering a web site and ripping off the 1995 work. MY OPINION.\\n\\nNow Croft can say all he wants that he found it playng his guitar or whatever he is claiming.\\n\\nThe fact is anyone can document Adoni with Prime theory from the 1990's saying 30mod, 60mod and 90mod is the key.\\n\\n9 Years later sieve of atkin appears, well that's only a rehash of the adoni 60mod work from the 1990's. Yet no one is giving him credit.\\n\\n2010 croft puts out his 30Mod work and its inserted into PyPrimes on Github and it smokes every major prime algorithm there is and all of them have pages on wiki as I cited.\\n\\nSo 2012 a work on Github verifies how important to primality the 30mod spirals are, but he says croft spirals, well guess what HelixQ is now out there and taking 100% credit for the 1995 work of Dr. Adoni.\\n\\nMy site to a Drexel math site from the 1990's mentioning 30Mod prime work (prime spirals) is a major cite, since Adoni could care less about the AMA or whatever, in all probability he will soon be nominated for a Nobel on his work, that is how important it is. \\n\\nThink about it, not one prime algorithm could beat the ancient sieve of Eratosthenes, none of them. On a computer creating primes all other algorithms are terribly slow. The only two fast generators from scratch are the ancient sieve of Eratosthenes and the PRIME SPIRALS, and the winner was Prime Spirals. Now I can cite recent news articles about it, laughing at academics it links to that said it was no big deal in the 1990's who now all look foolish due\",\n",

       " array(['\", 9 March 2006 (UTC)\\n\\nWhat a complete crock.  By calling everyone under the age of 18 a \"\"child\"\", which the dictionary correctly defines as a human between the ages of infancy and puberty, you can make everything even remotely sexual sound salacious and evil.  Teenagers are insulted to be called \"\"children,\"\" and if you start using terms like \"\"teenage sex\"\" and \"\"teenage sex with adults\"\" to describe problematical behavior by kids old enough to know better, the \"\"poor little abused children\"\" angle is more difficult to sell.  Maybe we should just go to the ultimate extreme, and legally define everyone under 18 as a \"\"baby.\"\"  Then all sex with minors could be \"\"poor little babies being abused and raped,\"\" which would no doubt please the Judith Reisman\\'s, John Ashcroft\\'s, and David Finkelhor\\'s of the world.  When such semantic games have to be employed to sell an agenda, with disqualification of everyone holding a different perspective as \"\"perpetuating the abuse\"\", what you have is pseudo-science and flim-flam, and not unbiased reporting. 20:10\"',\n",
